## [Moon Lander](https://codegym.cc/projects/games/com.codegym.games.moonlander)

### Rules:
- The objective is guide a landing module down to the lunar surface. To do this, the player must overcome the Moon's gravitational attraction, using an aft booster to slow the descent and side thrusters to move the ship left or right.
- The terrain is bumpy and there's only one flat area suitable for a soft landing. We'll call it the "platform". If the player lands successfully, he or she wins.
- The score depends on how long the landing lasts: The longer a player takes to land, the lower the final score.
- The game ends when the player smashes into the surface of the Moon.

- make several landscapes/levels.
